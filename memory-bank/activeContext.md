# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus
The project is now in the final step: **Step 11: Final Review and Submission**.
The immediate focus is on performing a full code review, ensuring all components work together, and then submitting the project.

## 2. Recent Changes
- **Professional `README.md` Created**: The root `README.md` file has been written, containing comprehensive information about the project.
- **Enhanced Backtesting Framework**: The backtester is feature-complete.
- **Hybrid Decision Engine Implemented**: The system can combine classic and LLM model outputs.
- **Ollama LLM Client Implemented**: The LLM client is feature-complete.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  Perform a final review of all code and documentation.
2.  Run the full pipeline to ensure there are no integration errors.
3.  Submit the project for final approval.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- The modular structure will be: `src/data.py`, `src/features.py`, `src/classic_model.py`, `src/llm_client.py`, `src/backtest.py`, and `src/main.py`. This is a slight refinement of the plan to better name `classic_model.py`.
- The LLM will be prompted to return a JSON object containing a `signal` and an `analysis` field to facilitate easy parsing.
