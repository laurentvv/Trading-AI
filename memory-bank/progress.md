# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: Phase 3 (Finalization and Documentation) is in progress.
- **Last Completed Step**: Integration of macroeconomic data into the classic model and documentation updates.
- **Current Step**: Finalize all documentation and perform final testing.

## 2. What Works
- **Tri-Modal Hybrid Engine**: The system is fully integrated and can generate a final decision based on the enhanced classic model (with macro data), a text-based LLM, and a visual-based LLM.
- **LLM Client**: Can query both text and visual models.
- **Chart Generator**: Can produce financial chart images.
- **Macroeconomic Data Integration**: The system successfully fetches data from FRED, caches it, and incorporates it into the classic quantitative model's features.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **Final Testing**: A thorough end-to-end test to ensure all components work perfectly together with the new macro features.
- **Minor Documentation Polish**: Final checks on `README.md` and `QWEN.md`.

## 4. Known Issues
- No new known issues. The system is feature-complete pending final testing.

## 5. Recent Fixes
- **2025-08-18**: Fixed a critical bug where the application would crash if the `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` was not set as a system environment variable. The code was updated to load the key from a `.env` file, and a startup check was added to ensure the key is present.
- **2025-08-19**: Fixed a bug preventing the final classic model from training correctly due to `NaN` values introduced by new macroeconomic features. Implemented data cleaning to ensure stability.
