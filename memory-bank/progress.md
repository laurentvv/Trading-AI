# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: Phase 3 (Finalization and Documentation) is in progress.
- **Last Completed Step**: Implementation of a robust scheduler and correction of critical runtime errors.
- **Current Step**: Monitoring the system's stability and data acquisition. Finalizing documentation.

## 2. What Works
- **Automated Scheduler**: A new, robust scheduler (`src/scheduler.py`) is in place, ensuring daily analysis runs automatically and reliably.
- **Tri-Modal Hybrid Engine**: The system is fully integrated and can generate a final decision based on the enhanced classic model (with macro data), a text-based LLM, and a visual-based LLM.
- **LLM Client**: Can query both text and visual models.
- **Chart Generator**: Can produce financial chart images.
- **Macroeconomic Data Integration**: The system successfully fetches data from FRED, caches it, and incorporates it into the classic quantitative model's features.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **Final Testing**: A thorough end-to-end test to ensure all components work perfectly together.
- **XAI Implementation**: Implement SHAP for model explainability as planned.
- **Minor Documentation Polish**: Final checks on `README.md` and `GEMINI.md`.

## 4. Known Issues
- **Resolved**: The previous scheduler was non-functional and causing daily analysis to fail. This has been resolved with the new `src/scheduler.py`.

## 5. Recent Fixes
- **2025-09-06**: Replaced the faulty and missing scheduler with a new robust scheduler (`src/scheduler.py`). This fixed critical runtime errors (`AttributeError: '_check_performance_alerts'` and `TypeError: JSON serializable`) that were preventing the daily and weekly tasks from completing successfully.
- **2025-08-19**: Fixed a bug preventing the final classic model from training correctly due to `NaN` values introduced by new macroeconomic features. Implemented data cleaning to ensure stability.
- **2025-08-18**: Fixed a critical bug where the application would crash if the `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` was not set as a system environment variable. The code was updated to load the key from a `.env` file, and a startup check was added to ensure the key is present.
