# Project Progress

## 1. Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: Phase 3 (Finalization and Documentation) is in progress.
- **Last Completed Step**: Integration of the 3-model hybrid engine.
- **Current Step**: Update all documentation.

## 2. What Works
- **3-Model Hybrid Engine**: The system is fully integrated and can generate a final decision based on the classic model, a text-based LLM, and a visual-based LLM.
- **LLM Client**: Can query both text and visual models.
- **Chart Generator**: Can produce financial chart images.

## 3. What's Left to Build
- **Documentation Updates**: The Memory Bank and the main `README.md` need to be updated to reflect the new 3-model architecture and visual AI feature.

## 4. Known Issues
- No new known issues. The system is feature-complete pending final testing.
